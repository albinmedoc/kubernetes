  # Custom Prompts
  OLLAMA_NSFW_PROMPT: |
     Analyze this image and provide probability estimates in the following categories, ranging from 0 to 1 (higher values indicate a higher probability):
     Neutral: Likelihood that the content is neutral and not sexual in any way
     Drawing: Likelihood that the image is a sexual illustration or drawing
     Hentai: Likelihood that the image contains adult anime or manga content
     Porn: Likelihood that the image contains explicit adult content
     Sexy: Likelihood that the image contains suggestive adult content
  OLLAMA_LABELS_PROMPT: |
     Generate one- or two-word labels that best describe the image. Anwser in Swedish.
  OLLAMA_CAPTION_PROMPT: Create an interesting caption that sounds natural and briefly describes
     the visual content in up to 3 sentences. Avoid text formatting, meta-language,
     and filler words. Do not start captions with phrases such as "This image", "The
     image", "This picture", "The picture", "A picture of", "Here are", or "There is".
     Instead, start describing the content by identifying the subjects, location, and
     any actions that might be performed. Use explicit language to describe the scene
     if necessary for a proper understanding. Anwser in Swedish.
